# THEMEMAKER

## What is this?

THEMEMAKER is a chrome extension to instantly (sort of) apply a random (kinda) color theme to ANY website. Guaranteed to work 100% or your money back. (jokes on you this is free so you won't be getting anything). Themes are provided courtesy of [The Color Api](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) ([source](https://gitlab.com/joshbeckman/thecolorapi)).

## Why does this exist?

Colors are awesome. Themes are awesome. Why don't websites provide custom themes?

## OK I'm sold, how do I use it?

- Clone this repo locally somewhere you won't forget about it
- In Chrome, go your extensions page (`chrome://extensions/`) and toggle "Developer Mode" on the top right
- Click "Load Unpacked"
- Navigate to the downloaded folder and select it
- Have fun
